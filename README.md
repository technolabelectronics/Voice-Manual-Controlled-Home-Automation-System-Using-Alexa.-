# Introduction
In this project we will control our appliances using Alexa and apart from this Alexa, We will also control via manual switch button as we traditionally do.
and we can also control devices from amazon Alexa smartphone application and also monitor the status of devices either it is ON or OFF.
You can give instructions to Control your devices even in your regional language.
Like in Hindi.

Apart from these features I also created routine.. for example if in the night I want to turn off all the devices. Just we need to say Good NIGHT.

And in morning if we want to turn on all the lights just we need to say good morning.

This is very Basic routine...you can create routine according to your need.

here our Alexa will directly connect to ESP32 via local server, so we don't need any third party cloud.

for making of this project we only need Alexa smart speaker and 8 node SMT Home-automation PCB.

In case if you don't have Alexa speaker, even then you can make this project using amazon Alexa smartphone application , which is available for iOS as well as Android.
And this smartphone application will work in same way as the Alexa speaker smart work.
You can install these PCBs in your office, house to make your dump devices smart.
This home-automation PCB is very small in size and compact which can easily fits in your electrical switch boards.
This PCB is compatible for all the smart speakers available in the market like Amazons Alexa , google home and Apples SIRI.
